# GitHub

- GitHub is a web-based hosting service built around `git`
- It supports hosting git repositories, user management, etc.
- There are other similar services, e.g., GitLab, bitbucket

- We will use GitHub to distribute the assignments, and other class materials. Our
  use of git/GitHub for the class will be minimal; however, we encourage you to
  learn how to use it for collaborations in general.

## Setting up a GitHub Account

- NOTE: You do not have to do this for this class -- `git clone` and `git pull` can be
  used without an account.

- Repositories hosted on `GitHub` for free accounts are public; however, you can
  easily sign up for an educational account which allows you to host 5 private
  repositories. More details: https://education.github.com/

- Create an account on Github: https://github.com
- Generate and associate an SSH key with your account
- Instructions to generate SSH keys: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-linux
    - Make sure to remember the passphrase (or even better do not use a passphrase)
    - Go to Profile: https://github.com/settings/profile, and SSH Keys (or directly: https://github.com/settings/ssh)
    - Add SSH Key

## Clone class repo
- In Terminal on your laptop:
  ```
  > git clone ...
  ```
- The master branch should be checked out in a new directory
- Familiarize yourself with the basic `git` commands
- At a minimum, you would need to know: `git clone, add, commit, push, pull, status`
- 
- You should also be familiar with how to use branches
- You can't push to the main class repository, but feel free to do pull requests on
  the main class repository if you spot any errors or if you think something could
  be improved.
